**Teralikinnq** (or just **Tera**), more commonly known on YouTube as **KingGraphs** (formerly **KingStats**) was a former statistics content creator from the New England region of the USA that uploaded videos through most of 2021. His statistics videos back then consisted mainly of bar chart races. As time moved on however, he began advancing and made videos of higher quality than before, and posted more frequently. He used to upload videos every day, but then reduced it to a schedule of posting videos a few days apart as his higher quality videos took some time to work on.
