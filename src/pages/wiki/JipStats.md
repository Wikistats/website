**Jip** (most commonly known as **JipStats**, formerly **JipIsPlaying**, **Jip Plays**, and **StatsComparisons**), is a statistics YouTuber who makes high quality subscriber count visualizations and sub count timelapses. At his peak, he uploaded daily, but now he only uploads weekly to improve video quality and take a break.

# Partnership

<br />

Jip partnered with **Graphify** in August 2022, which later made him start to make high quality streams. He also partnered with [RSC Statistics](/wiki/RSC), and started a collaboration member with him.

# BLACKPINK Effect

<br />

Jip started a stream about [BLACKPINK](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/BLACKPINK)'s song 'Pink Venom'. The stream later began to blow up, and Jip hit 1K, 2K, and 3K relatively quickly.
